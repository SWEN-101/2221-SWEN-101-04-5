                        Pathways is moblie application targeted toward seniors, people with disabilities, and anyone else in need of useful, concise information about assistance services. 
                        Pathways provides quick and easy environmental information, such as the location of wheelchair accessible ramps, reported elevator maintenance, 
                        locked entrances, and much more. Pathways also has a verbal assistance tool, meaning users who may struggle with digital interfaces can simply speak to access
                        what they need along with the navigation sidebar.
                        Our approach to basic and easily understandable information extends to services such as weather alerts, emergency contact database, and customization features.
                        We aim to provide our users, namely seniors, with a concise source of information, as they often find it difficult to understand the intricate details of smartphones and application use.

                        We hope this will streamline the routes taken by those in need of special accommodations.
